                    <strong> Why Is This Course Relevant Today? </strong>
                    <br>
                    There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions.
                    <br>
                    The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong> What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course? </strong>
                    <br>                    
                    By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language â€“ JavaScript. Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.
                    <br>
                    Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong> Should I Come Equipped With Anything? </strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the necessary free software.
                    <br>
                    At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous programming language experience is required.
